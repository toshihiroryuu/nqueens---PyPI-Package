Description: # N-Queen Problem
        
        The "N-Queens Problem" is a classical problem of chess. Here N Queens are to be placed on an N * N chessboard in such a way that no queens attack each other. A Queen can  attack other Queens if its placed on the  same row, column or on its diagonals. We use Backtracking in the backend to solve this problem .

             def __init__(self, n = 0, algo = "backtrack", pos = []):
                  self.n = int(n)
                  self.algo = algo
                  self.pos = []
                  self.count = 0
                  self.queen_data = []
